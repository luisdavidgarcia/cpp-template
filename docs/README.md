Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for the `cpp-template` project.

## Table of Contents

1.  **[API Reference (Doxygen)](./html/index.html)**: Detailed documentation 
of the C++ codebase, generated by Doxygen. Includes class hierarchies, 
function descriptions, and file overviews.
2.  **General Guides**
    * **[Contribution Guidelines](./general/contribute.md)**: How to set up 
    your environment, follow coding standards, submit pull requests, and more.

## How to Generate Documentation

To generate the Doxygen API reference, run:

```bash
